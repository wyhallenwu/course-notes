# course-notes
This repository contains course notes in Shanghai University. 

I'm now an undergraduate student at school of Computer Science and Engineering in Shanghai University. These notes may contain some materials that I can't share due to the intellectual property. But the I'll list the material I use in the README. I'll use both English and Chinese to write these notes, it all depends on my ability and spare time. If you find it useful, I would appreciate it if you could star this repository.

Acknowledgment: some notes are export from my notion notes. If you want to know  more about notion , please check notion official website https://www.notion.so/
