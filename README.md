This repository contains course notes in Shanghai University. I'm now a undergraduate student at school of Computer Science and Engineering in Shanghai University. These notes may contain some materials that I can't share due to the intellectual property. But the I'll list the material I use in the READM. If you find it useful, I would appreciate it if you could star this repository.
