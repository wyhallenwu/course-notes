<i>2021-12-18 Yuheng Wu</i>

This readme file is a brief introduction of this repository. Learning timeline is recorded in the schedule.md file.

This file contains my learning records of the course Database Principles at Shanghai University. 

In this repository, I may use both English and Chinese, because the course is conducted in Chinese, some materials may cause misunderstandings if translated. Also, I'm not a native English speaker and if you find somewhere can be polished, please contact me.
