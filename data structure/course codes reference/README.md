These are course codes of Data Structure (1)  Shanghai University.  I'm not sure the source of these codes. If you find it infringes your copyright, please contact me to delete it.

The reference book for this course is "数据结构--C++第二版" ISBN：978-7-03-040739-9. 

But I'm strongly recommend you use another book such as "Data structures and algorithm analysis in C++ / Mark Allen Weiss, Florida International University. — Fourth edition."  which will give your much more clear explanation.
